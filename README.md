## 🧩 Problem Description
Water and electricity are essential resources, yet a significant amount of wastage occurs in households due to a lack of awareness and monitoring. Most users do not have a clear or simple way to understand how much water and electricity they consume on a daily or monthly basis.
The absence of visual insights, usage trends, and comparisons leads to inefficient consumption and increased utility bills. This problem is highly relevant in today’s world where sustainability, conservation, and responsible usage of resources are critical for environmental protection and long-term availability.
